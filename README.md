# About me
## I’m a first-time adult learner at the young age of 35, with a middle-schooler and high-schooler in tow :) . I thought when they got older, they would slow down, but alas, I run on coffee, ambition, and a lot of chaos. My brain doesn’t shut off, and neither do I. Academically so far, I’ve completed BAS-120, 121, and 150. BAS-121 was my favorite, being able to take my data driven questions, my need for creativity and color, mesh them together and make colorful dashboard that intrigued my neurospicy brain.
